To create a README file for your Python code executed in Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the problem and the purpose of the code. Mention that the code calculates the posterior probability for each Pokemon type given the features of Mandibuzz using Naive Bayes classification in Google Colab.

2. **Code Description**:
    - Briefly describe the Python script and its purpose.
    - Explain the use of Google Colab for running the code.
    - Describe the libraries used, such as pandas, matplotlib, and fractions.
    - Explain the structure of the training data and how it's processed.
    - Describe the calculation of prior probability, likelihood, and posterior probability for each type.
    - Mention the visualization created to display posterior probabilities as fractions using a bar plot.

3. **Instructions**:
    - Provide instructions on how to run the Python script in Google Colab.
    - Specify any dependencies that need to be installed, although Google Colab typically comes pre-installed with many libraries.
    - Include any additional setup required, such as uploading the dataset to Google Colab.

4. **Output**:
    - Include a brief summary of the output generated by the script.
    - Mention the predicted Pokemon type and the posterior probabilities for each type as fractions.

5. **Conclusion**:
    - Summarize the results obtained from the analysis.
    - Discuss any insights gained or conclusions drawn from the analysis.

6. **References**:
    - Include any references to external sources or documentation used in the development of the code.

Here's a basic example of how the README file could be structured:

```
# Naive Bayes Classification for Pokemon Types in Google Colab

## Introduction
This Python script executed in Google Colab calculates the posterior probability for each Pokemon type (Normal, Water, Flying) given the features of Mandibuzz (HP=Mid, Attack=High, Defense=Mid) using Naive Bayes classification.

## Code Description
- The script defines a training dataset consisting of Pokemon attributes such as HP, Attack, Defense, and Type.
- It calculates the prior probability, likelihood, and posterior probability for each type using Naive Bayes classification.
- The predicted Pokemon type is determined based on the maximum posterior probability.
- A bar plot is created to visualize the posterior probabilities as fractions.

## Instructions
1. Open the provided Python script in Google Colab.
2. Execute the code cells in Google Colab to run the script.
3. Ensure that the required libraries such as pandas and matplotlib are available in the Colab environment.

## Output
- The predicted Pokemon type is displayed along with the posterior probabilities for each type as fractions.

## Conclusion
The analysis predicts the most likely Pokemon type for Mandibuzz based on its features. The results provide insights into the classification of Pokemon types using Naive Bayes classification in Google Colab.
